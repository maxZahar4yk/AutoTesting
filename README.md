## 📌 About

This project represents an **automated testing framework for web applications**, designed to improve software quality assurance by reducing manual testing effort and increasing test reliability and repeatability.

The framework enables automated execution of functional test scenarios, validation of user interface behavior, and verification of core business logic in web-based systems.  
It follows industry-standard practices in automated testing, emphasizing **scalability, maintainability, and extensibility**.

---

## ⚙️ Architecture Overview

The framework is built using a **layered architecture**, separating responsibilities between test logic, page interaction, and configuration:

- **Test Layer** – contains test cases and test suites
- **Page Object Layer** – encapsulates UI elements and user actions
- **Core Utilities** – browser management, configuration, logging
- **Data Layer** – test data and parameterization
- **Reporting Module** – test execution results and logs
